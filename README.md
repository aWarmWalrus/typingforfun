# Typing For Fun
A personal project because I actually type as a way to relax, and
I want to be able to experience books and stuff while doing so! It's
supposed to be like typeracer but more relaxing.

# Setting Up the Project
This project runs on Ruby on Rails, and uses a Postgresql Database.
I'm currently developing this on Ubuntu 16.04, and used
https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04 to set up Ruby, Rails, and Postgre.
